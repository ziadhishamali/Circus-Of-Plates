# Circus Of Plates
It’s a single player game built using Java and the power of design patterns, where there’s a clown carrying two sticks with plates falling from above and he is trying to collect as many 3 consecutive plates of the same color as he can with 3 different difficulty levels and cool special gifts for him to collect.
